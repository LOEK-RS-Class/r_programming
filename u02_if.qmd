# if-else

Sometimes you want code that executes only in certain conditions. This is done via `if-else` structures like the example below. The `condition` in the if-statement expects `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Use logical operators to build an expression that turns out either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

if(condition){
  # Command 1
  
} else{
  # Command 2
  
}

```

## Task
`sample(10, 1)` outputs a random number between 1 and 10. Write a if-else statement:

* If the number is larger than 5, print the message "A large number".
* If the number is smaller than 5, print the message "A small number".
* If the number is exactly 5, print "It's 5"
