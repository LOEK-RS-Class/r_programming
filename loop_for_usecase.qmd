# For Loop Usecase

The following dataset contains the average summer temperatures per year in Germany. You can download it [here](https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/regional_averages_DE/seasonal/air_temperature_mean/regional_averages_tm_summer.txt).




```{r}
dwd = read.csv("https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/regional_averages_DE/seasonal/air_temperature_mean/regional_averages_tm_summer.txt", sep = ";", skip = 1)
knitr::kable(head(dwd))
```

The code block below calculates the long term average summer temperature between 1960 and 1989 for Bayern.





```{r}
# mean temperature in Bayern between 1960 and 1989
mean(dwd[dwd$Jahr >= 1960 & dwd$Jahr <= 1989, "Bayern"])
```
