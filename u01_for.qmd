# for-loops


:::{.callout-important}
## Task

In the Learnweb, download the 5 Meteosat scenes (MSG SEVIRI). 

* Write a loop that:
  * reads one scene
  * creates a RGB composite
  * save a pdf file of the RGB composite.

:::


Hints:

* with `list.files("directory_path" , pattern = ".tif$")` you can create a vector that contain the file paths
* use `plotRGB` from the `terra` package with the argument `asp = 1` to prevent image distortions
* to name the pdf output files, use the iterator variable like this `paste0(“output”,i,”.pdf”)`
